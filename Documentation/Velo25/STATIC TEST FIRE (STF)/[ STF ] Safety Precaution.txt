`Potential Faults`
- The Arduio data analysis Fails to record data
- The calibration of Load cell measurement is Skewed
- The Ignitor Fails to Start the Motor
- The Motor Underperforms
- The Motors Overperforms
- Containment failure of Motor

`Safety pecatuions`
- Have the code Do Status Checks and ensures That it has steady connection with ADC  
- Have procedures for Post processing of correcting skewed values listed out 
- Ensure To have Back-up ignitors and atleast 2 types of ignitor
- Analysis of The Data is requried 
- The Motor firing will be Performed Under strict and regulator conditions, with Potential prepaared for worst case senarios
- The Motor testing will be done with special permission and with enough safety clearence 
- Worst Case containment Failure of Motors is not possible due to proper Engineering and Design 


`General safety precaution`
- Everyone Must stay behind the caculated Dead zone of 6m , We have decided with a safety distance of 10m 
- However, Underconditions of Low SNR due to long cabling, Temporary mesurements and operators can stay within 3-6 meters with Blast Reflector and Eye and ear protection
- In case of ignitor failure, The Arm switch should be Cut and a wait of 30s is suggested before approching the motor (15s is time required for the ignitor to cool to room temp)
- All electronics Must be Encased in Protective cases,
- Electronics and Workstation once setup, should not be moved , to prevent Yanking of cables and electronics Faults
- Eye protection for those within (10m Standby zone), additional Ear protection  for those within (6m Dead Zone)
- Non Club members should be issued a Warning of the Firing at the time of ignition.
- Keep a Fire extinguisor at standby
