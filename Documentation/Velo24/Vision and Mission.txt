## Vision
This club aims to serve as a platform for students passionate about electronics, focusing
on strengthening both the practical and theoretical understanding of this dynamic field.


## Mission
Motor Design and Chemistry
To focus on the development of rocket motors, including the study and application of chemical propellants. 
This will not only provide a practical understanding of chemistry but also enable the club to create custom-built
 rocket engines, a critical aspect of rocketry.
