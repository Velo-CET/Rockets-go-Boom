We like our rocket Standing
We like to Push Gas
Pointy at the Top
Deying Gravity, Defining Inovation
reaching out to space
Blast away
Come fly with Us
From concept to Orbit
Launch beyond limits
Iginite launch explore
Laung big or Go home
Get high Legally
Come to Orbit
The firey end should be pointed down
Belive me ! it's not a Missile!
Pointy end UP, Fiery end DOWN
Rockets go Wheee !!
We love Rapid unscheduled Disassembly
Concept to Cosmos
Defying Gravity, Defining Destiny
